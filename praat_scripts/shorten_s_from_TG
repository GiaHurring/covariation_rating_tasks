#script to shorten a segment labelled /t/ to 40 ms
#to be used with the /s/ part of the biphonemic /ts/ sounds, to make it monophonemic (fricated /t/)
#requires a Sound object and a corresponding TextGrid with an interval tier (in which one interval is labelled "t")
#usage: 
#    1. open the sound and TextGrid to modify, select it in the Praat Object Window and click 'View & Edit'
#    2. select the interval labelled "t" and select Edit, Shorten_s_fromTG
